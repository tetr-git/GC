#FirstSteps

A simple project in Unity. A small two player game for a university course in computer graphics at HTW Berlin.

The first player who touches the flag three times in the middle of the gamefield wins. Shooting the other player results in a respawn of the eneny player at his starting position. Restarting the game generates a new maze.

Movement Player 1: WASD, Jump leftShift + Shooting C
Movement Player 2: IKJL, Jump rightShift + Shooting N

Use of an autogenerated maze from gamedolphin
